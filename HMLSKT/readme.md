by Aurélien Géron](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)


By using concrete examples, minimal theory, and two production-ready Python frameworks—Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow—author Aurélien Géron helps you gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts and tools for building intelligent systems. You’ll learn a range of techniques, starting with simple linear regression and progressing to deep neural networks.

Code examples are available online as Jupyter notebooks at https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2.
