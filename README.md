IDE

[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) notebooks are [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks 

Colab, or "Colaboratory", allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with
- Zero configuration required
- Access to GPUs free of charge
- Easy sharing

JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning.
